<h1 class="title">Becoming a Project Manager</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">After a year of being a consultant, it’s true: software is about people.</h2>
</div>

<div class="col-12">
<p>As consultants, we’re never just thinking about delivering code. Although it can be the majority of our work, clients don’t hire us just because we can get things done, they hire us to become <em>partners</em> in their work. So when I began to feel comfortable consistently delivering code for my client, I also began to see other ways that I might provide them value.</p>
<p>Thinking back to <a href="https://leanpub.com/thesecretsofconsulting">The Secrets of Consulting</a> by Gerald Weinberg, I, naively, felt like a great next step could be to identify cultural and structural opportunities for growth at the client. Unfortunately, although I can pontificate just as well as any other, I lacked the knowledge, skills, experience, clout, perspective, authority, and ability to effect real change. I led a few retros and raised the flag on many concerns, but I was out of my league. Not only that, I was taking on imaginary work for myself—work that was already being handled by more-capable hands.</p>
<p>So, I went back and doubled-down on what I knew I could do: focus on delivering the best code that I could. But, the software I was helping to build wasn’t about the <em>code</em>, it was about <em>people</em>, and the challenges the team was facing couldn’t be solved by writing “better” code.</p>
<p>That’s why I decided to work to become a <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/certified-associate-capm">Certified Associate in Project Management</a>. Passing a CAPM certification exam shows that the project manager has accumulated tools and techniques to manage various phases of a project’s life cycle: procurement, risk, communication, resources, quality, cost, schedule, scope, and integration across both technical and business domains.</p>
<p>Project management sits in a sweet spot for me; it’s about project delivery, but also about the process. Fundamentally, everyone on the team is responsible for the success of a project in one form or another, and as consultants, we’re either managing our internal operations, managing our client relationships, managing a client’s project, or managing our individual deliverables. All of these responsibilities require processes that fall under the skill set of a project manager. From procurement to cost/risk analysis, team communication to timelines, each project shares similar steps along its life cycle.</p>
<p>I always want to spend the majority of my time writing code, but like all good generalists, I want to take advantage of every opportunity to grow in new ways! My hope is that the skills I learn during this process will help me feel more confident when taking on responsibilities at the client, in the office, and in my personal projects.</p>
